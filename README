	BFI didn't read loops correctly. Any loop with a depth of 3 or more stopped at the 2 loop, hence "many basic programs work on it". All .bf files should work on it now.

    Basic interpreter. Some loops don't work, for some reason. Will look into it further at some point.As of right now, many basic programs work on it. Input output is functional. Debug mode added and fully functional. May beautify it at some point.
