Brainfuck interpreter written in C++.

0.1 - May 11 2015
    Basic interpreter. Some loops don't work, for some reason. Will look into it further at some point. As of right now,
    many basic programs work on it. Input output is functional. Debug mode added and fully functional. May beautify it
    at some point.
